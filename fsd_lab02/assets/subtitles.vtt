Hi. My name is Otto, I am from Klagenfurt, Austria.

00:04.000 --> 00:08.000
And I strongly suggest that if you’re thinking of visiting Greece,

00:08.000 --> 00:11.000
think twice!

00:11.000 --> 00:13.000
It was 2013.

00:13.000 --> 00:15.000
I had a burn out,

00:15.000 --> 00:17.000
so I took a plane to Greece.

00:17.000 --> 00:20.000
From the moment I stepped my foot on that country,

00:20.000 --> 00:25.000
something weird started happening.

00:25.000 --> 00:27.000
It was the first time I was feeling this way…

00:27.000 --> 00:29.000
strange I guess,

00:29.000 --> 00:32.000
a little bit awkward in the beginning.

00:32.000 --> 00:34.000
You know the Greeks…

00:34.000 --> 00:37.000
always trying to connect with you

00:37.000 --> 00:39.000
and all this sea

00:39.000 --> 00:40.000
and sun

00:40.000 --> 00:42.000
and white

00:42.000 --> 00:46.000
tiny houses everywhere!

00:46.000 --> 00:47.000
Look at me!

00:47.000 --> 00:49.000
Can you imagine?

00:49.000 --> 00:51.000
But, no matter where Ι travelled,

00:51.000 --> 00:53.000
it still felt strange.

00:53.000 --> 00:55.000
In some places,

00:55.000 --> 00:56.000
Ι remember

00:56.000 --> 01:01.000
Ι could hear my own breathing.

01:01.000 --> 01:03.000
Anyway, listen!

01:03.000 --> 01:05.000
Think before you go!

01:05.000 --> 01:06.000
Why?

01:06.000 --> 01:09.000
I told you, my friend! It’s that feeling!

01:09.000 --> 01:11.000
Once you’re in Greece,

01:11.000 --> 01:15.000
you’ll want to stay forever!

01:15.000 --> 01:17.000
And maybe you do.
